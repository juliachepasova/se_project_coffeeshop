This is the second project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

## Plan on improving the project

Add another animation to make the website more interesting for the users. Animation can include circles on the background to move around or disintegrate into several parts.
Add a map using iframe so the visitors can see the location of the coffeshop.
Add a background music so visitors can listen to some cool playlist while browsing through the website.
